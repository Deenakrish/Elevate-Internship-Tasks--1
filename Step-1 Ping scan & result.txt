                                                                  Cyber Security Internship — Task 1: Network Scanning

Operating System: Linux
Note: Nmap is pre-installed on my system, so there was no need for manual installation.

                                                              STEP 2: Identified My Local IP and Verified Connectivity

What I Did:
I identified my local IP address and pinged it to ensure that the network connection was working properly.

                                                                          Command 1: Identify Local IP Address

Command Used: ip addr show

Description:
This command displays all network interfaces and their assigned IP addresses. From this output, I identified my system’s local IP address.
The /24 indicates the subnet mask 255.255.255.0, meaning the network range is 192.168.1.0 – 192.168.1.255.

What I Got:10.178.100.19/24

                                                                      Command 2: Test Connectivity and Save Results

Command Used: ping -c 4 <ip-address> > ping_results.txt

Description:
This command sends 4 ICMP echo requests to the specified IP address to verify network connectivity.
The -c 4 flag limits the ping test to 4 packets.
The > operator redirects the output and saves it to a file named ping_results.txt.
Use >> instead of > to append results to the same file instead of overwriting it.
A successful reply (no packet loss) indicates the host is reachable and active.

What I Got:
