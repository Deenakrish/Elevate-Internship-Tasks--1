                                                                     STEP 2 — Nmap Scan

Date: 13-11-2025
Target network: 10.178.XX.XX
OS: Linux (Nmap pre-installed)

SUMMARY:
I used Nmap to discover live hosts, open TCP/UDP ports, service/version information, and OS fingerprints on my local network .
                                                                              
                                                                 Command A — Default quick scan

Command used: nmap 10.178.XX.XX

Description:
Runs Nmap’s default scan (TCP SYN/Connect on common ports) across the /24 network. Good for a fast initial look.

Nmap Result:

Host is up (0.0000090s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT    STATE SERVICE
443/tcp open  https

Result Explanation:
Hosts up: 2
10.178.XX.XX — Host is up.
Open TCP ports: 53/tcp (domain)
10.178.XX.XX — Host is up.
Open TCP ports: 443/tcp (https)
Summary: two hosts discovered; DNS (53/tcp) on .105 and HTTPS (443/tcp) on .19.

                                                          Command B — TCP SYN scan (network-wide)

Command used: sudo nmap -sS 10.178.XX.XX

Description:
Performs a TCP SYN (half-open) scan over the network to discover open TCP ports. Requires root (sudo) for raw packet sending.

Nmap scan report for 10.178.XX.XX
Host is up (0.000012s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT    STATE SERVICE
443/tcp open  https

Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 4.48 seconds

Result Explanation:
10.178.XX.XX— 53/tcp open (domain)
10.178.XX.XX — 443/tcp open (https)
Summary: same open ports as the default scan; confirms 53 on .105 and 443 on .19.

                                                      Command C — Full TCP Port, Service, and OS Detection Scan

Command Used: sudo nmap -sV -O -p- -T4 10.178.XX.XX

Description:
Exhaustive TCP scan (all 65,535 ports) with service/version detection (-sV) and OS detection (-O). Scans every host in the /24 network range and identifies active services and operating systems. More intrusive and detailed, suitable for comprehensive network assessment on a trusted LAN.

Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 38.29 seconds

Result Explanation:
Host: 10.178.XX.XX
Status: Up (latency ~0.0034s)
Open TCP ports:
53/tcp — open — domain — dnsmasq 2.51

Device / OS:
Device type: phone
Running: Google Android 10.X (Linux 4.X)
OS details: Android 9–10 (Linux 4.9–4.14)
Network distance: 1 hop
Host: 10.178.100.19
Status: Up (latency ~0.000081s)

Open TCP ports:
443/tcp — open — ssl/https
Nmap could not fully identify the service/version; it observed HTTP-style responses (302, 401, 404) and suggested submitting the fingerprint to nmap.org.

Device / OS:
Device type: general purpose
Running: Linux 5.X | 6.X
OS details: Linux 5.0–6.2
Network distance: 0 hops

Summary:
Two hosts discovered up in the 10.178.XX.XX scan: 10.178.XX.XX and 10.178.XX.XX
10.178.XX.XX runs dnsmasq 2.51 on TCP/53 (DNS).
10.178.XX.XX serves HTTPS on TCP/443; Nmap returned HTTP responses but could not fully fingerprint the HTTPS service/version.
