                                                      Step 3 — Vulnerability-oriented Service & Version Scan

Summary:

In Step 2 we discovered open ports and service/version info (e.g., 10.178.xx.xx: 53/tcp — dnsmasq 2.51, 10.178.xx.xx: 443/tcp — HTTPS).
Now we run Nmap’s scripting engine (NSE) with vulnerability scripts to check those discovered services for known CVEs, exploits, and common misconfigurations. This converts raw open-port data into actionable security findings you can prioritize (patching, firewalling, configuration fixes).

Command used: sudo nmap -sV --script=vuln 10.178.xx.xx

Description:
Service/version detection (-sV) plus vulnerability-oriented NSE scripts (--script=vuln) across the 10.178.xx.xx network. This probes services for versions and runs safe vuln checks that report known CVEs/misconfigurations. 

Nmap scripting results:
Host — 10.178.xx.xx
Status: Up (latency ~0.0026s)

Open TCP port(s):
53/tcp — open — domain — dnsmasq 2.51
Vulnerability highlights (reported by NSE/vulners):
Multiple high-severity entries found for dnsmasq 2.51 (examples in report): CVE-2017-14493, CVE-2017-14492, CVE-2017-14491, CVE-2020-25682, CVE-2023-50387 — several with high CVSS / exploit references.
Output lists many exploit references (Exploit-DB, PacketStorm, etc.) — see vulners section in saved output for full links.

Device / OS info:
Device type: phone
Running: Google Android 10.X (Linux 4.X)

OS details: Android 9–10 (Linux 4.9–4.14)

Note: dnsmasq on a local device acting as DNS/DHCP is exposed — requires patching or network hardening.

Host — 10.178.xx.xx
Status: Up (latency ~0.000004s)

Open TCP port(s):
443/tcp — open — ssl/https (service not fully fingerprinted)
NSE vuln/script highlights:
http-slowloris-check: Likely VULNERABLE to Slowloris-style DoS (CVE-2007-6750).
http-method-tamper: VULNERABLE — HTTP verb tampering detected (possible authentication bypass via unusual HTTP methods on certain URIs).
http-csrf / http-stored-xss / http-dombased-xss: No issues found (scripts returned no findings).
Nmap captured HTTP-style responses (302 redirect to /app/login, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found) — indicates a web app with a login/redirect flow and cookie-based session.

Device / OS info:
Device type: general purpose
Running: Linux 5.X | 6.X (Linux 5.0–6.2)
Network distance: 0 hops

Note: web service shows authentication & redirects but also practical misconfigurations (verb tampering, Slowloris exposure) — harden web server, disable unnecessary HTTP verbs, add rate-limiting.

Quick actionable recommendations:

Patch/upgrade dnsmasq on 10.178.xx.xx to the latest stable release (address CVEs).
Restrict access to DNS/DHCP services — limit to trusted networks / firewall rules; do not expose DNS to unnecessary hosts.
Harden web server on 10.178.xx.xx:
Disable or properly handle uncommon HTTP methods (reject unsafe verbs).
Implement rate-limiting and connection/timeout hardening to mitigate Slowloris.
Review authentication flow and cookie settings (Secure/HttpOnly already present in responses).
